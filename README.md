Tapper Tracker is a data visualization tool for beat keeping.

Based on a research study I conducted through The Music Cognition lab at Tufts University, Tapper Tracker is a game with real-time visual feedback for every tap in response to a rhythm. Users can be scored for 1x (800ms), 2x (400ms), and 4x (200ms) beat trials.

The core functionality of the app can be found in app/assets/javascripts -- the rails backend is simply for serving and storing user scores.
