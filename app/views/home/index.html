    <h3> So what is Tapper Tracker? </h3>
    <p>
      Tapper Tracker is a visualization tool for tapping to a steady beat. When you choose a tap rate a metronome will begin playing - your goal is to tap along! With every tap, you can see how well you are maintaining the beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      ...
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4> The Graphs </h4>
    <p>
      You have two different representations of your beats - a line graph and a circular graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line graph is the time between your taps (the green line is your average). The metronome is 800ms, which is why it is the middle value. For '1x' your target is 800. For '2x' it is 400, and for '4x' it is 200.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle graph will plot one yellow line for each tap you make. The line will show where your tap falls relative to the beat. Try tapping different speeds to see how the graph reacts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plans to improve further:
      1. Log tapping stats for aggregate analysis
      2. Restore user accounts + introduce a user survey for segmentation (e.g. hearing complications or musical training)
      3. Visualize more stats (e.g. taps beyond standard deviations)
